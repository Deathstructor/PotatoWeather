# Potato Weather Project

In this project I am going to make a weather application for iOS using the Swift programming language.
I will be programming the application i Xcode and I will use Swift Playgrounds to learn the language.

### The application
This application will be pretty simple as I want to make a basic weather app. These are some features that this app will have:
- Weather at your current location using location services
- Display of current weather and temperature
- 10-day forecast
- A search feature to seach for a specific city
- Settings to be able to personalize the app

Some of these features are more necessary than others, but these are all of the features that I would like to include in my app.

### Challenges
There will be a few challenges for me in the process of making this application. The first one will be to learn a new programming language. I have never programmed i Swift before or made a phone application, so i need to learn how to do it. Another challenge that I will face is the use of APIs. I will need to use an API to get weather information and that's something that I have only learned the basics about in C#. The last and probably least problematic challenge for me is to make a good and usable user interface (UI). I have never really worked with UIs on a more advanced level before, which means that should learn how to make a good UI.
